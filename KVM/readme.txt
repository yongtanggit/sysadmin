INTRODUCTION
------------

I use virtual machines every day. I am tired of typing all the commands and options. This project is created for automating most KVM tasks I perform daily. It includes following programs:

<> virt-hostinst.sh
<> virt-network.sh
<> virt-vminst.sh
<> vmkill.sh 

REQUIREMENTS
------------

These programs are tested with Bash on a Centos 7 host. 

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
-------------------

Root privilege is required to run these programs.
